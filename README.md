## Overview

![screenshot](./src/assets/screenshot.png)

I liked the challenge in general, except having two inputs that do the same task, one in the main page and another one in the hidden component, made me lose some time because I didn't find a clear logic, so I had to change it.

In this challenge I have learned to understand better how is the reactivity and how to pass data between components in svelte.
